# Hatchways Backend

This was my first back-end application using express and node. I was challenging and exciting exploring new technoogies.

### Timeline

I was unable to complete the assessment in one session. During the week, I also had personal/family challenges that needed my attention.

### Questions

Your feedback is appreciated and makes me a better developer, along with your grading criteria. Would it also be possible to get feedback in these areas:

- How would I implement server-side cache
  - Do I need a library/framework?
  - Or an OOP design pattern?
  - How would the program determine where to query? The cache or the API?
- I got stuck on testing API calls and asynchronous behavior; could you point me in the right direction?

### Thank you for your time.
